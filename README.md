## By Brittany Lindgren & Benjamin Russell

## Description

Create an app that will help the user view cars available at a dealership.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

| Steps | Example |
| -------- | ----- |
|  1. Follow this [link to the project repository](https://github.com/LINDGRENBA/ping-pong-2) on GitHub.   |    |    
|  2. Click on the "Clone or download" button to copy the project link.   |   ![Image of GitHub Clone or download button](img/readme/clone-download-button.PNG)   |   
|  3. If you are comfortable with the command line, you can copy the project link and clone it through your commad line with the command `git clone`. Then run the command `npm install` followed by `npm run build`. Otherwise, I recommend choosing "**Download ZIP**".   |   ![Download ZIP option on GitHub](img/readme/download-zip.PNG)  |   
|   4. Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, you can right click on the file to view the zip folder in your downloads.   |   ![ZIP folder in downloads](img/readme/zip-folder.PNG)  |   
|  5. Right click on the project ZIP folder that you have just downloaded and choose the option "**Copy To...**", then choose the location where you would like to save this folder.    |   ![Saving ZIP to new location with 'Copy To'](img/readme/copy-to.PNG)  |   
|  6. Navigate to the final location where you have chosen to save the project folder.   |     |   
|  7. To view the code itself, right click, choose "open with..." and open using a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.   |     |
